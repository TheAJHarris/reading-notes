# Welcome to the wonderful world of markdown.  

## Just wanted to share a few things that I learned with you today.  
1. The basics of markdown are fairly easy to learn, it's more repetition and practice than anything.
1. Once the basics are learned, there is a whole world of commands you can use to expand your skillset. 
      - __Just an example of what we learned today, by placing two asterisks at the beginning and end of your words,
      you create a bold font__
