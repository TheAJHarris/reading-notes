# Welcome to the wonderful world of markdown.  

## Just wanted to share a few things that I learned with you today.  
    - The basics of markdown are fairly easy to learn, it's more repetition and practice than anything.
    - Once the basics are learned, there is a whole world of commands you can use to expand your skillset. 
      *Just an example of what we learned today, by playing asterisks on both ends of your words, you create a bold font*
