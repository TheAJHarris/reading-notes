# REFLECTION AND DISCUSSION

1. GIT is a DVCS that allows users from around the world to share their code and collaborate.
1. ACP is ADD, COMMIT, PUSH, which describes the process for amending code.
1. GIT stash may be the most useful code line I have heard of thus far, it allows you to add/remove changes with ease.
